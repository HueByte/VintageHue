# HueHordes v1.0.0

**Release Date:** 28/09/2025
**Target Game Version:** Vintage Story 1.21.1

## Added

### Core Horde System

- **Periodic horde spawning system** that creates waves of hostile entities around players
- **Configurable timing system** with default 3-day intervals between horde events
- **Ring-based spawn mechanics** with customizable radius (12-24 blocks from player)
- **Multi-entity support** with configurable entity types (defaults to drifter-normal)
- **Smart spawn count management** (default: 8 entities per horde)

### AI & Behavior Systems

- **Clean AI architecture** with modern entity behavior system
- **AIBehavior** - Entity behavior that handles pathfinding and targeting
- **Smart targeting system** with line-of-sight detection
- **Base detection capabilities** for intelligent horde targeting
- **Advanced A* pathfinding** with 3D navigation and obstacle avoidance
- **State management** with NavigatingToBase, AttackingTarget, and DestroyingDoor states
- **Door destruction system** with health tracking and coordinated attacks

### Configuration Management

- **Server-side JSON configuration** (Horde.server.json) with the following options:
  - `DaysBetweenHordes` - Interval between horde events (default: 3 days)
  - `Count` - Number of mobs per horde (default: 8)
  - `SpawnRadiusMin/Max` - Spawn distance range (default: 12-24 blocks)
  - `EntityCodes` - Array of entity types to spawn
  - `NudgeTowardInitialPos` - Enable movement toward player (default: true)
  - `NudgeSeconds` - Duration of nudge behavior (default: 20s)
  - `NudgeSpeed` - Movement speed multiplier (default: 0.05)
  - `EnableDebugLogging` - Enable debug logging system (default: false)
  - `DebugLoggingLevel` - Debug logging level 0-3 (default: 1)

### Administrative Commands

- **`/horde spawn [playername] [count] [entitytype]`** - Spawn entities around player for testing
- **`/horde detectbase [playername] [radius]`** - Test base detection for player
- **`/horde spawntobase [playername] [count]`** - Spawn entities that target player's base
- **`/horde debug [playername] [mode]`** - Debug visualization with particle system
### Debug Commands

- **`/horde <command> [args]`** - Main horde management system with integrated debug visualization

### Advanced Pathfinding & Visualization

- **3D A* pathfinding** with entity-aware coordinate system
- **Particle debug system** for real-time path and base visualization
- **Entity base detection** with intelligent targeting
- **Door health management** with coordinated destruction
- **Debug logging system** with comprehensive AI event tracking

### Technical Features

- **Modern entity behavior system** with clean state management
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation systems
- **Game tick integration** with 5-tick intervals for efficient processing
- **Performance optimization** with stuck detection and path caching
- **Type safety** with strongly-typed configuration models
- **Debug visualization** with particle system integration

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- Built as a Vintage Story Code Mod using C# and .NET 8.0
- Implements ModSystem base class for proper game integration
- Uses Vintage Story API 1.21.1 for full game compatibility
- Follows async/await patterns for modern, non-blocking code execution

### Entity Spawning

- Supports any Vintage Story entity code (full or domain-less)
- Ring-based spawning algorithm prevents entities from spawning too close to players
- Intelligent spawn validation to ensure entities spawn in valid locations
- Custom nudge behavior temporarily guides entities toward player positions

### Performance Optimizations

- Async AI systems reduce game lag during horde processing
- 5-second tick intervals balance responsiveness with performance
- Efficient base detection algorithms minimize computational overhead
- Smart targeting reduces unnecessary entity scanning
